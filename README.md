Background: Aleix has been working as a recruiter for over eight years, with a primary focus on finding skilled candidates for roles in tech and engineering. With a degree in Human Resources and professional certifications in recruiting for technology roles, Aleix has developed an eye for quickly identifying candidates who fit job requirements, from both technical and cultural perspectives.

To find a contact method to reach out directly or save my resume for later review, depending on recruiting needs.

Aleix often encounters poorly organized websites that make it difficult to locate key information.
Aleix prefers sites that have a clear, organized structure and are mobile-friendly, as a significant part of his role involves reviewing profiles on the go.
Preferred Experience: Aleix appreciates a visually appealing but professional-looking CV website that provides:

A clear, immediate overview of the candidate's skills, experience, and profile photo.
Quick access to a downloadable resume and straightforward contact options.
Linked social media accounts to explore more about the candidate’s interests and network.
Scenario: Aleix is currently recruiting for an entry-level software development role and needs to screen my profile to assess his suitability. He would start by scanning my skills and project experience, verifying relevant details in the resume, and potentially saving the contact page for further outreach.

# Information Architecture
The website is structured as a multi-page CV with consistent elements that ensure a cohesive user experience across all sections. Each page includes a header with my name and social media icons linking to my Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter profiles. These icons are positioned prominently for easy access to my professional social media accounts. The site also features two main navigation buttons that change based on the current page. These buttons offer links to key sections, such as Resume, Contact or My profile, ensuring that users can always find what they're looking for. At the bottom of every page, there’s a footer that includes copyright information, which adds a sense of professionalism and consistency throughout the site.

Here’s a breakdown of each page’s content:

My profile Page: This page  introduces me with a profile picture and a brief introduction. It also contains a detailed section showcasing my skills, both technical and interpersonal. The skills section highlights my proficiency in areas such as programming (C++, C, Java), web development (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap), problem-solving, and teamwork. This combined layout makes it easier for visitors to get both an overview and a deeper understanding of my abilities all in one place. The page includes buttons to navigate to the Resume and Contact sections.

Resume Page: This page is dedicated to providing detailed information about my work experience, education, and language skills. The content is divided into clear sections, each with a header and bullet points for easy scanning, making it straightforward for users to review my qualifications. The page includes buttons to navigate to the My profile and Contact sections.

Contact Page: The Contact Page features a simple contact form where users can directly inquire about opportunities or connect with me. It also includes a downloadable PDF version of my CV for users to save and refer to later. Additionally, the social media links are repeated here to facilitate further engagement. The page includes buttons to navigate to the My profile and Resume.

# Visual Design
The visual design of the website employs a blue and white color scheme with a focus on readability, simplicity, and professionalism. Blue is used as the primary color to create a sense of reliability and focus; it is applied to key elements such as headers, section titles, and buttons. This approach not only enhances the design’s visual appeal but also subtly reinforces a professional tone. The background uses a clean white and light gray to ensure that the text stands out, with ample whitespace creating a balanced and uncluttered look.

For typography, Arial is chosen for its clean, sans-serif style, known for readability across devices. The design uses a clear hierarchy in font sizing to help the user navigate the content easily, with the header title in a bold, larger font and section headings in medium-weight. The main text is kept in a smaller, regular weight for easy reading, allowing the viewer’s attention to flow naturally from one section to another without overwhelming them.

Responsive design is ensured through Bootstrap’s grid system, which adapts to different screen sizes. The My Profile page, for instance, arranges the profile photo and bio text side-by-side on larger screens, while it stacks them on smaller screens for an optimal viewing experience. Additionally, slight hover effects on social media icons and buttons add a touch of interactivity, subtly engaging users without distracting them from the primary content. Each icon has a rounded, branded outline to distinguish the respective social media platforms, adding a personalized touch to the website.
